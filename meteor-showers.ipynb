    "# Project : Meteor Shower\n",
    "by Shubham Tiwari, 18 Jan 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the project notebook for the Microsoft's Explore space with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meteors can be visible from Earth every night. But the best meteor showers are the ones that originate from one of the comets that orbits around our sun. To see those meteor showers, beyond knowing the path of the comets, we must also consider the side of the Earth where the meteors will enter our atmosphere. And we must consider whether the night sky will be dark enough to optimize our view of the meteor tails.\n",

    "# What are meteor showers?\n",
    "Meteoroids are objects in space that are typically made of dust, rocks, or metal. They can range from small grains of dust to small asteroids. They're essentially space rocks floating out in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "When meteoroids get near Earth, gravity pulls them into our atmosphere, where they begin to burn. That burning is the light we see in our skies. In this state, meteoroids are called meteors. If a meteor passes through the atmosphere without completely burning, it lands somewhere on Earth and is then called a meteorite.\n",
    "\n",
    "NASA estimates that 48.5 tons of meteoric material fall to Earth each day. Most meteors are completely burned in our atmosphere. The best place to find the ones that reach Earth's surface is the desert or an icy place like Antarctica. They're easier to find in these places because by the time they land on Earth, meteorites look similar to any rock you'd find in your yard. It's difficult to distinguish them from rocks that naturally occur on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meteoroids can originate from comets, asteroids, moons, or planets. The most common source of meteor showers is comets. This module focuses on comets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about meteors and meteor showers on the NASA Solar System Exploration website (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/overview/)."

    "Before we gather data, it's important to identify the kind of data that we want to find. We know a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meteor showers are typically caused by meteoroids that melt off of comets.\n",
    "- Comets have an orbit around the sun that's observable and predictable.\n",
    "- A bright Moon makes a meteor shower harder to see.\n",
    "- The orbit and spin of Earth affects where a meteor shower can be seen from Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select comets to focus on\n",
    "Although meteoroids can come from comets, asteroids, moons, and planets, this Project focuses on meteoroids that come from popular comets. We can use four comets to predict when and where meteor showers will be visible. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comet Thatcher\n",
    "Comet Thatcher (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/c-1861-g1-thatcher/in-depth/) was first discovered in 1861. It takes 415.5 years for comet Thatcher to orbit the sun.\n",
    "The debris from this comet creates the Lyrids meteor (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/lyrids/in-depth/) shower each April. The first recorded sighting of the Lyrids meteor shower goes back to 687 BC.\n",
    "The Lyrids meteor shower appears to come from the direction of the constellation Lyra. But the comet and meteor shower don't actually originate from this constellation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comet Halley\n",
    "Comet Halley (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/1p-halley/in-depth/) was first discovered in 1531. However, only in 1705 was it discovered that the comet sighted in 1531, 1607, and 1682 was the same comet.\n",
    "Comet Halley takes 76 years to orbit the sun. The debris from this comet creates the Eta Aquarids meteor shower (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/eta-aquarids/in-depth/) each May and the Orionids meteor shower (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/orionids/in-depth/) each October.\n",
    "The Eta Aquarids meteor shower appears to come from the direction of the constellation Aquarius. The Orionids meteor shower appears to come from the direction of the constellation Orion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comet Swift-Tuttle\n",
    "Comet Swift-Tuttle (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/109p-swift-tuttle/in-depth/) was first discovered in 1862. This comet takes 133 years to orbit the sun. Debris from this comet creates the Perseids meteor shower (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/perseids/in-depth/) each August.\n",
    "It wasn't until 1865 that it was understood that this meteor shower originated from Comet Swift-Tuttle. The Perseids meteor shower appears to come from the direction of the constellation Perseus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comet Tempel-Tuttle\n",
    "Comet Tempel-Tuttle (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/55p-tempel-tuttle/in-depth/) was independently discovered twice, in 1865 and 1866. This comet takes 33 years to orbit the sun. Debris from this comet creates the Leonids meteor shower each November.\n",
    "Every 33 years, the Leonids meteor shower (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/leonids/in-depth/) becomes a meteor storm. A meteor storm is when there are at least 1,000 meteors per hour. The Leonids meteor shower appears to come from the direction of the constellation Leo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moon phases\n",
    "As the Moon (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/) orbits Earth, and Earth orbits the sun, different amounts of sunlight are reflected off the Moon to Earth. Each month, the Moon cycles through different phases. The phases are basically the names we apply to how much sunlight we see reflecting off certain parts of the Moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the phases of the Moon:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New Moon: Around the 15th of the month\n",
    "- Waxing crescent\n",
    "- First quarter: Around the 23rd of the month\n",
    "- Waxing gibbous\n",
    "- Full Moon: Around the 1st of the month\n",
    "- Waning gibbous\n",
    "- Third quarter: Around the 10th of the month\n",
    "- Waning crescent\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "New Moon, first quarter, full Moon, and third quarter are the most frequently tracked phases. The phases cycle every 29 days, so the exact dates depend on the number of days in the month.\n",
